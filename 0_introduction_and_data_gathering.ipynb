    "The lute is a stringed instrument that enjoyed great popularity during the Renaissance and was still widely used in the Baroque period. It has an incredibly large repertoire, but much of it is still inaccessible because it remains hidden in historical books and treatises scattered across hundreds of libraries and collections. The dataset we will examine for this project was created by Sarge Gerbode, a private lute enthusiast who has made it his mission to digitize these works and make them publicly available. For this purpose, he takes scans of historical documents that contain lute music from libraries and collections to encode the pieces using the music notation program Fromino. Fromino is a piece of software designed for typesetting early music in tablature, the (family of) musical notation that was used for lute music. He puts the results on his website and documents his work in an excel spreadsheet each row of which represents one piece encoded in Fromino. The columns of the spreadsheet contain information about the title, composer, source, etc. of the pieces, as well as links to the files exported from Fromino: files in Fromino's own format, PDF scores and MIDI files.\n",

    "\n",
    "And here the Fromino software\n",
    "+ https://sites.google.com/view/fronimo/home\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is definitely interesting for people who are curious about early music, as it covers an important part of Western music history for which datasets usually take the form of books and are therefore difficult to process using statistical or computational methods.  Regarding its reliability, it should be noted that it was not created to serve as material for musicological research. Its main purpose is to make the works of Renaissance lute composers accessible to music performers. Therefore, we should assume that it is not a representative sample and contains some errors or inaccuracies here and there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, I will first provide a brief overview of the dataset and its important variables, and then outline the plan for the project."

If we look at the distribution, we can see that lute music was published from around 1500 and reached a peak in the late Renaissance around 1600. In the following Baroque period, the lute was still in use, but we have much fewer pieces in our dataset. This does not necessarily reflect a historical development, but rather the fact that the encoder focuses mainly on Renaissance music. We also have some outliers -- probably mostly arrangements of older or modern pieces."

The most common type are lute songs, i.e. pieces for one or more voices with lute accompaniment (possibly with other instruments as well). Other important types of pieces are various kinds of intabulations (lute arrangements of (polyphonic) vocal music), dance pieces such as galliards, pavanes, courantes, allemandes, etc., and freer forms of often virtuosic soloistic pieces such as ricercars, fantasias, toccatas, etc."

    "**MIDI Features:** The first analysis can be found in the Notebook \"1_composer_comparison\". In this part we take advantage of the fact that we have access to the MIDI files of the pieces. We  pick two composers -- the Italian lute virtuoso Francesco da Milano and the German-Hungarian lutenist Hans Newsidler. Our goal is to build a logistic regression model that uses musical features such as range and tempo to distinguish between the two composers. This is an explanatory rather than a predictive task: which musical features best explain the differences between the compositional styles of the two composers? As a first step, we download the MIDIs and use the Python library music21 to extract relevant musical features from them. We then do a quick exploratory analysis and use Lasso regression to select the most important features for our model. Finally, we build and interpret the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composer Data and Network Graph:** The second analysis is divided into two notebooks, one for the data collection (2_1_scrape_composer_data) and one for the actual analysis (2_2_composer_migration_and_publication_network). In the first notebook, we obtain some information (namely town, country, and date of birth and death) about the composers in our dataset by scraping two online composer databases. In the second notebook, we use this information to map the migration flow of composers between countries and the places where they worked. Next, we explore connections between composers by creating and exploring a network graph in which composers serve as nodes and are connected by an edge if there is a historical publication that contains pieces of both composers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis:** For the final analysis (3_text_extraction_and_sentiment_analysis), we download the PDF scores of all lute songs in our dataset. Recall that lute songs are pieces for voice and lute accompaniment. Therefore, some of them contain one or more verses of text. We convert the PDFs to text files and attempt to extract the lyrics of the English lute songs. Then, we use a pre-trained text classification model to assign emotion scores to the songs. Using these scores, we identify the most emotional pieces, compare composers, and see if pieces in minor keys have sadder lyrics than those in major keys."

The general idea is that we can give the spider a list of links which it will follow to parse the html. Doing so, it can extract new links from the html, feed them to its methods which again follow them to parse the html and so on. The idea behind the spiders for both our websites is the following. For each unique composer name we construct a link that leads us to the list of results we get when we search for the name on the website. If we get a good fuzzy match with one of these search results, we follow the link and hopefully end up on the correct composer site. Here we find the desired information which we save in one of the above dictionaries. The details differ as the two sites are structured differently, but I suppose you don't want to look at it that closely."

    "We can see the text we want to extract, but it's burried in a lot of nonsense. So we have to do some cleaning. In particular we have to extract the lines of text two of which we can observe here. For this we will make use of the fact that they are always contained between two \\n elements. We will also try to put them in the correct order. If we keep the order they appear in we get the first line of the first verse followed by the first line of the second verse and so on. For this purpose we define two functions. The first removes some unwanted elements. The second is meant to extract and reorder the lines of text."

    "The obvious spike close to zero probably consists of pieces that do not contain any English text, but where short bits of nonsense, annotations or texts in other languages where erroneously classified as English text. Thus, we drop all pices whose text length is shorter than 100 characters. Subsequently, we manually inspect (and possibly exclude) some of the remaining shorter texts. Since many pieces appear in  different versions which usually have the same text, we drop the duplicates with respect to the pieces' titles."
